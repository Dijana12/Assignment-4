# Purpose of the Repository
This repository includes the code and results for a data analysis assignment that focuses on estimating logistic regression models. The objective is to understand how different factors influence a binary outcome by progressively increasing model complexity. Several models are created to predict a binary variable and identify the factors affecting the probability of a specific outcome.
